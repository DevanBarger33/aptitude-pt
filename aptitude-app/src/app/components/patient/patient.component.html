        <h4>How Much Will It Cost?</h4>
        <p>Costs are different for different patients and different treatments. After your initial evaluation, your physical therapist will be able to estimate the usual charges and average length of treatment for a similar condition. You may ask to see a list of charges and ask for an explanation of how charges are billed. Our office staff is available to discuss charges, payment options, and insurance reimbursements. Please bring a copy of your insurance card, and we will help file your insurance claim.</p><br>
        <p>If you do not have health insurance or if you prefer to pay out of pocket, our self-pay rates are as follows:</p><br>
        <ul>
          <li>$70   -   Initial Evaluation</li>
          <li>$55   -   Per Session (after initial evaluation)</li>

        <h4>What to Wear to Your Appointment...</h4>
        <p>Wear loose, comfortable clothing, especially if you will be in the exercise area. We do have hospital gowns available if you need them for evaluations, such as knee injuries. You can also bring clothes to change into since we have private rooms available.</p>

        <h4>Where to Find Us</h4>
        <p>Our office is located at 1342 East Primrose Street between National and Fremont in Springfield, Missouri. The easiest way to enter our parking lot is coming from the west to turn right because there is an island on Primrose at our entrance that prevents a left turn coming from the east.</p><br>
        <p>Our office is on the main floor in Suite A.</p>
